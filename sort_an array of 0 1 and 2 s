// eg arr = [1, 2, 0, 0,1, 1, 2, 2]
// output should be [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,2]

1st solution 
count the number of 0s, 1s and 2s and create an array of that many 0's and push those many 1 and 2s.
time complexsity O(N) to find the number of digits and another O(N to create the sorted array.
space complexity is 1 which will store N numbers

2nd solution 

consider 3 pointers
min mid will point to 0th position ang high will point to last index.
depending on the mid value will take the move
